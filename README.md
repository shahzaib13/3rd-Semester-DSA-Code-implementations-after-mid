# 📚 Data Structures Implementation (C++)

![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-C++-blue.svg) ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Educational-green.svg)

Welcome to this repository! This collection contains **fundamental implementations** of various Data Structures in C++. These codes are written specifically to match the logic and teaching style covered in our course lectures.

> **Note:** While online tutorials (YouTube) often use STL or different logic, these implementations focus on the **manual approach** required for our academic curriculum.

## 🗂️ Table of Contents

The data structures are implemented in the following order:

1.  **Stack** (Array/Linked List based)
2.  **Queue** (Circular/Linear)
3.  **Linked List** (Singly/Doubly)
4.  **Deque** (Double Ended Queue)
5.  **Tree Traversals** (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)
6.  **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
7.  **Heaps** (Min Heap & Max Heap)

## ⚠️ Disclaimer & Important Notes

Please read this section carefully before using the code:

* **Potential Bugs:** While I have tested these codes and they seem correct from my side, there is always a possibility of minor mistakes or edge cases. If you find any, please feel free to fix them or let me know!
* **Base Implementations:** These are the *basic* and *proper* implementations of the structures.
* **Exam Preparation:** Do not rely solely on memorizing these codes. In exams, you might be asked to solve **advanced problem sets** or modify these structures. These codes are just the building blocks.

## 🚀 How to Study

To make the most out of this repository, follow this study pattern:

1.  **Analyze the Logic:** Don't just copy-paste. Read the code to understand *how* pointers and arrays are being manipulated.
2.  **Use AI Assistance:** If a specific function or logic is confusing, copy the code into **ChatGPT** or **Gemini** and ask it to explain the flow step-by-step.
3.  **Compare with Lectures:** Use this repo to bridge the gap between YouTube tutorials and what was actually taught in class.
4.  **Practice Advanced Problems:** Once you understand these basics, move on to solving complex problems (e.g., LeetCode or HackerRank) using these concepts.
